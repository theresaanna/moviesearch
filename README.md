# Movie Search

## Getting Started

I have not tried a prod build, I've been using the app in dev mode.

### `cd moviesearch`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Automated Tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Notes
- The hamburger and x icons on mobile view are ugly. the animation is a little janky, too. I didn't want to spend too too much time here, though.
- The small breakpoint starts at something like 576px in React Boostrap, so it's not exactly 600px where mobile comes in.
- I struggled to mock API responses and didn't have enough time for actual test coverage as I'd like.
- The next thing I would do is add ARIA roles.
- Thanks for reviewing!
